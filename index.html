    Introduction
    Synthesthesia is a simple Synth plugin for people who are beginning their journey into the world of audio. 
      
      It consists of:
      - 1 oscillator that can switch between a Sine, Sawtooth, and Square wave
      - An envelope that modulates the oscillator signal
      - A filter component that can switch between low-pass band-pass, and high-pass filters
      - An envelope that is modulating the filter
      
      It also features:
      - A waveform that changes along with the parameters chosen by the user
      - Pop-up buttons that explain what each component it and what it does.
      
      Synthesthesia is available as a VS3, AU, and Standalone plugin.
