    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
    Synthesthesia is a simple Synth plugin for people who are beginning their journey into the world of audio. 
      <br>
      It consists of:
      <br>
      - 1 oscillator that can switch between a Sine, Sawtooth, and Square wave
      <br>
      - An envelope that modulates the oscillator signal
      <br>
      - A filter component that can switch between low-pass band-pass, and high-pass filters
      <br>
      - An envelope that modulates the filter
      <br>
      <br>
      It also features:
      <br>
      - A waveform that changes along with the parameters chosen by the user
      <br>
      - Pop-up buttons that explain what each component is and what it does.
      <br>
      
      Synthesthesia is available as a VST3, AU, and Standalone plugin.

    <h2>Methods and processes applied</h2>
   <p> 
     There was a lot of trial and error involved in this project. I did a lot of reasearch and tried to implement different components that ended up not being 
     compatible with my software version, or just not working for some reason. I definitely had to do some digging to find ways to implement the features that I wanted.
     Ultimately, I ended up with 3 component classes (ADSR, Filter, OSC) for the UI, 3 for the backend Data, and an additional 4 classes for my Source code. My Data classes connect to my SynthVoice class (which is 
     responsible for the actual sound), and my UI classes connect to my Plugin Editor (which is responsible for the UI). The Plugin Processor class is responsible for tracking 
     changes made by the user and updating the parameters accordingly. Below are some screenshots from my code, to give a general idea of how things are set up.

    <p>
      My SynthVoice class is contains the functions needed to get sonic information from the AudioBuffer. The AudioBlock has a list of pointers to channels containing the necessary
      sample data. I have code attatching my Oscillator, Envelope, and Filter components to the AudioBuffer (so they can have an effect on the sound). The bottom of the above screenshot 
      shows a function that checks when a midi key is no longer being pressed, so that the sample data can be cleared from those channels (and save processing power on your computer).

    <p> 
      My PluginEditor class holds the GUI components. I abstracted the individual Oscillator, Envelope, and Filter UI into their own classes, which were then referenced here. The screenshot 
      above shows code that actually places each piece of UI on the screen. I also have code that places the informational pop-up buttons on the screen, adds the on-click functionality, and 
      adds the text message.

      <h2>Findings/Concluding Thoughts</h2>
   <p> 
    I was really interested in revisiting the JUCE framework, and I had wanted to make 
    a synth for a long time. However, I was trying to think about what I could do 
    differently with it because there are a lot of synth plugins out there. I thought 
    that it would be really interesting to have a synth that is made for beginners, 
    specifically people who are interested in audio but donâ€™t know where to start. I 
    feel that a lot of audio software out there require you to have prior knowledge in 
    order to do something with it, so I made this synth thinking that beginners would 
    probably enjoy exploring sound freely without having to think about it took much. 
    I feel like that demographic would benefit from having something that explains what 
    things are and what they do, and having a visual component to help them conceptualize 
    what is happening to the sound wave when they change different parameters.
